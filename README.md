## Project Structure

  - **`src/components/sections/`**: Specific components for each section of the portfolio (Hero, About, etc.).
  - **`src/components/ui/`**: UI components from shadcn/ui.
- **`src/data/`**: Centralized content for the portfolio.
  - **`src/data/portfolio-data.ts`**: Edit this file to update your portfolio information (name, contact, projects, skills, etc.).
- **`src/ai/`**: Contains the Genkit AI flows.
